# weather-dashboard

This webpage allows the user to search for a city. The page then fetches weather forecast data from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) and displays it to the screen. It shows details for the current day as well as the five-day forecast. Previously searched cities are saved as additional search buttons so users can quickly search for the same cities again.
